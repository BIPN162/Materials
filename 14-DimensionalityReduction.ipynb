    "**Dimensionality reduction** is an incredibly useful tool in data science as well as neuroscience. Here, we'll explore one main method of dimensionality reduction: **Principal Components Analysis**. We'll first generate a dataset, then perform PCA step-by-step, and then learn the very simple commands to do this in Python. Lastly, we'll use *k*-means clustering to find clusters in the two-dimensional PCA data.\n",
