    ">  In visual cortex, running depolarizes both PNs and inhibitory cells. The resulting increase in both excitation and inhibition in PNs reduces membrane potential variance, and leads to more stimulus-evoked spikes without any increase in spontaneous activity (Polack et al., 2013). Whereas cholinergic input affects membrane potential fluctuations during quiescent periods, the effect of locomotion on membrane potential variance is mostly dependent on noradrenergic input. Interestingly, SOM neurons do not show decreased membrane potential variability during running, suggesting a differential influence of norepinephrine on SOM neurons and PNs (Polack et al., 2013). Different classes of inhibitory neurons show marked differences in how they are modulated by locomotion in the visual cortex. VIP neurons are depolarized throughout the entire running period, while PV cells only respond transiently at the beginning. SOM neurons are typically suppressed during running, and fire mostly at the end of the running period (Fu et al., 2014). These results suggest that the effect of locomotion is mediated by a disinhibitory circuit, in which VIP cells inhibit SOM cells and thereby increase the activity of neighboring PNs. \n",
