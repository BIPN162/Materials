    "The Cognitive Atlas web interface is useful, but limited in what we are able to analyze, in a large scale sense. Here we are going to interact with the [Cognitive Atlas](https://www.cognitiveatlas.org) \n",
    "via its [Python API](https://github.com/CognitiveAtlas/cogat-python).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use this database, along with Neurosynth, to address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. What is working memory?\n",
    " 2. What concepts are related to it?\n",
    " 3. What parts of the brain have associations from the literature?\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**API means \"application programming interface\"** and it really is exactly that: a set of functions that you can call from a programming language (e.g., Python and R are common languages for scientific programming) to interact with a resource (for example, a database) to answer some question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, APIs are essential for science - there are questions that, in order to answer, might require interaction with datasets beyond the ability of a human. We can't easily answer all queries that we might have about cognitive knowledge in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here are some more advanced use cases that would require programming and (some) graph theory:\n",
    "\n",
    " - What cognitive concepts are represented across a database of over 1 million articles from the literature\n",
    " - **how** similar is working memory to all other concepts in the atlas?\n",
    "     - Can you give me a number?\n",
    "     - Can you define a threshold of significance?\n",
    " - What parts of the brain, represened by coordinate locations reported in the literature, are associated with the concept?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond using the Cognitive Atlas as a lookup for terms, you can see that there are many use cases in research that would warrant interacting with it programatically, integrated with other tools, or scaled. Today let's explore one of these use cases - the third - and understand what areas of the brain might be involved with working memory."
